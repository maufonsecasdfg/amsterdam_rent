# Geometry

## Overview
Tools for generating maps between scraped data and geographical data. It aligns property postal codes to their corresponding administrative units (stadsdelen, wijken, buurten) and processes geometry files (e.g., GeoJSON) to visualize these areas on a map. Data is sourced from official datasets provided by [CBS](https://www.cbs.nl).

## Key Components
- **Spatial Mapping**: Scripts that associate postal codes with their correct administrative boundaries.
- **Geo-Data Processing**: Converting and preparing official geometry files into formats suitable for the dashboard.
